## Controlling Maintainability

Select the most fitting statement with respect to the handling of maintainability in your chosen project/product.
- We do not address maintainability at all.
- We somewhat implicitly address maintainability via e.g. basic refactoring and/or some team-wide standardization.
- We explicitly address maintainability in a non-systematic fashion via e.g. tool support and metrics, a quality model, and/or a medium degree of team-wide standardization.
- We explicitly address maintainability by enforcing a structured process, tool support, and a high degree of team-wide standardization.

ISO/IEC 25010:2011 is the standardization for “Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) -- System and software quality models” that also includes the quality attribute “maintainability”. Concerning this standard, select the most fitting statement.
- I did not hear about it before.
- I heard about it, but am not really familiar with its details.
- I am familiar with it.
- It is used as the base model for quality evaluation in my projects.

What tools are used for your chosen project/product to support maintainability control (e.g. SonarQube, FindBugs, Squale, Lattix, Ndepend, CAST, Structure101, Teamscale, etc.)?

What are the most important metrics that are used on your chosen project/product to evaluate maintainability related properties (e.g. LoC, cyclomatic complexity, comment ratio, clone coverage, test coverage, coupling metrics, cohesion metrics, etc.)?

## Maintainability Satisfaction
For the following sections, choose one of your more recent software projects or products and answer the question based on the work done in that context.
If you need additional information about ISO/IEC 25010, visit http://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010.

In your chosen project/product, are you satisfied with the overall degree of maintainability?
- No, not at all
- No, not really
- Yes, somewhat
- Yes
- Yes, very

What are symptoms of low maintainability that occur with your chosen project/product?
- Low release frequency
- High number of defects with new releases
- Reported issues are open for a long time
- Missing or outdated documentation
- Outdated libraries or middleware components
- More time needed to add new functionality
- Inadequate testing
- Lots of duplicate code
- Slow/manual deployment process
- Architectural erosion or complexity
- Many inter-module/inter-component dependencies
- Very large/complex components or modules
- Other: …
- No significant issues

ISO/IEC 25010 specifies 5 sub quality attributes for maintainability. With respect to your chosen symptoms above, select at most 2 quality attributes for which you experience the largest decrease in quality.
- Modularity
- Reusability
- Analyzability
- Modifiability
- Testability

Do you think the usage of a maintainability process, tools, or metrics in your chosen project/product improves the software quality?
- No, not at all
- No, not really
- Yes, somewhat
- Yes
- Yes, very much

Do you think the usage of a maintainability process, tools, or metrics in your chosen project/product hinders productivity?
- No, not at all
- No, not really
- Yes, somewhat
- Yes
- Yes, very much

Do you think the current maintainability-related effort (e.g. process, tools, or metrics) in your chosen project/product should change?
- A lot less
- Somewhat less
- Exactly the same
- Somewhat more
- A lot more


## Treatment of Service- and Microservice-based Systems

In your projects in general, does the maintainability process or the usage of tools and metrics differ when working on Service- or Microservice-Based Systems as opposed to other systems?
- No
- Yes, to some degree
- Yes, significantly

If so, what is done differently with these systems?

If no, why is there no difference with these systems?
- We do not know. We never thought about changing something.
- We thought about it, but do not exactly know what to change.
- We see no merit in doing something differently. Our standard approach is sufficient.
- We wanted to, but management or the customer did not allow it.
